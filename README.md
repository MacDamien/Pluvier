This project aims at creating a dictionary for French steno, based on the TAO/LaSalle realtime theory, using a corpus downloaded from Lexique.org.

This corpus contains about 140,000 words, with a lot of metadata (phonetics, grammatical categories, gender and number, frequency, syllables, information about conjugation, etc) which will help in the creation of the steno dictionary, since some aspects of the theory rely/will have to rely on grammar and such.

The whole set of rules can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Vermoot/80f40a00d06f291a85f2543e7e2870ee). I suspect there might be some gaps that will need to be filled, but we'll see how that goes.
