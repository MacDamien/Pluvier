This project aims at creating a dictionary for French steno, based on the TAO/LaSalle realtime theory.

The whole set of rules can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Vermoot/80f40a00d06f291a85f2543e7e2870ee). I suspect there might be some gaps that will need to be filled, but we'll see how that goes.
